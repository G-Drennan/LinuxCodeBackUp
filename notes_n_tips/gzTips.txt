gz sim <File.sdf>
 # Fortress and Citadel use "ign gazebo" instead of "gz sim"


#Add the -v 4 command line argument to generate error, warning, informational, and debugging messages on the console.

#Gazebo Sim can also be run headless, i.e. without the GUI, by using the -s (server only) flag.

#Similarly, the GUI can be run independently using the -g (gui only) flag. On start, the GUI will attempt to connect to a server instance. If a server is not available, then you will see just a blank screen until a server instances is started.


 #use  . /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh after source the workspace
